## Instructions

Your quest in Wim's World involves a series of enchantments and incantations using Houdini and a supplied FBX. Here's what you need to conjure up:

- Transmute the data type of objects or terrain as needed.
- Scatter and scale objects across the terrain with the grace of a seasoned sorcerer, ensuring everything looks as if it's been there since time immemorial.
- Summon forth a body of water, making sure it blends harmoniously with its surroundings.
- Purify the terrain mesh, removing any anomalies that disrupt the natural flow of the world.
- Mold the terrain to ensure all objects and elements are integrated seamlessly, creating a vista that invites exploration.

Feel empowered to modify data as you see fit, but remember: the goal is to craft a distribution that's not only mesmerizing but also viable for a modern game environment. Keep your incantations within reasonable limits of instances and mesh variations.

## Installation

Welcome to the enchanting setup process for Wim's World! To ensure a smooth journey into this whimsical realm, follow these magical steps:

### Preparing Your Spellbook (Installation Instructions)

1. **Locate the `Wim-s-World_Package.json` File**:
   - Begin by finding the `Wim-s-World_Package.json` file. It's the key to unlocking the gates to Wim's World in your Houdini environment.

2. **Copy the JSON File to Houdini's Packages Folder**:
   - With the JSON file at hand, navigate to your Houdini packages folder. You'll typically find this mystical place in your Documents folder, under `Houdini`.
   - If by chance you do not see a `packages` folder there, fear not! Simply conjure one into existence by creating a new folder and naming it `packages`.
   - Place the `Wim-s-World_Package.json` file within this newly formed or pre-existing `packages` folder.

### Enchanting the JSON File with Your Local Magic

Before you proceed, there's a small yet crucial enchantment required:

1. **Modify the `WIMSWORLD` Variable**:
   - Open the `Wim-s-World_Package.json` file with a text editor of your choice. Here, you'll find a variable named `WIMSWORLD` that holds the power to link your local realm to Wim's World.
   - You must change the value of `WIMSWORLD` from its current path (`"C:/Github/Wim-s-World"`) to the path where you've decided to store Wim's World
