# Wim's World

Welcome to Wim's World, a whimsical workshop where the terrain of creativity meets the sea of technical artistry. This is not just a test; it's an adventure into the heart of imagination powered by Houdini's magic. So, fasten your seatbelts, or rather, grab your wizard hats, as we embark on a journey to sculpt, scatter, and submerge into a world where every pebble is placed with purpose and every stream tells a story.

## Introduction

At Embark, we're not just creating games; we're weaving worlds. This Technical Art Test - Houdini Part is your portal to show us the spells you can cast with your tools and creativity. It's a glimpse into how you tackle challenges, morph landscapes, and breathe life into the digital wilderness.

### Good Luck and Have Fun!

Remember, this journey is as much about the destination as it is about the whimsy along the way. Let your creativity flow as freely as the body of water you're about to create. Show us how you can turn a terrain mesh and object meshes into a coherent, living, breathing ecosystem. Good luck, and let the fun begin!

## Instructions

Your quest in Wim's World involves a series of enchantments and incantations using Houdini and a supplied FBX. Here's what you need to conjure up:

- Transmute the data type of objects or terrain as needed.
- Scatter and scale objects across the terrain with the grace of a seasoned sorcerer, ensuring everything looks as if it's been there since time immemorial.
- Summon forth a body of water, making sure it blends harmoniously with its surroundings.
- Purify the terrain mesh, removing any anomalies that disrupt the natural flow of the world.
- Mold the terrain to ensure all objects and elements are integrated seamlessly, creating a vista that invites exploration.

Feel empowered to modify data as you see fit, but remember: the goal is to craft a distribution that's not only mesmerizing but also viable for a modern game environment. Keep your incantations within reasonable limits of instances and mesh variations.

## Installation
