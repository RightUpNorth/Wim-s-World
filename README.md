# Wim's World

Welcome to Wim's World, a whimsical workshop where the terrain of creativity meets the sea of technical artistry. This is not just a test; it's an adventure into the heart of imagination powered by Houdini's magic. So, fasten your seatbelts, or rather, grab your wizard hats, as we embark on a journey to sculpt, scatter, and submerge into a world where every pebble is placed with purpose and every stream tells a story.

## Introduction

At Embark, we're not just creating games; we're weaving worlds. This Technical Art Test - Houdini Part is your portal to show us the spells you can cast with your tools and creativity. It's a glimpse into how you tackle challenges, morph landscapes, and breathe life into the digital wilderness.

### Good Luck and Have Fun!

Remember, this journey is as much about the destination as it is about the whimsy along the way. Let your creativity flow as freely as the body of water you're about to create. Show us how you can turn a terrain mesh and object meshes into a coherent, living, breathing ecosystem. Good luck, and let the fun begin!

## Instructions

Your quest in Wim's World involves a series of enchantments and incantations using Houdini and a supplied FBX. Here's what you need to conjure up:

- Transmute the data type of objects or terrain as needed.
- Scatter and scale objects across the terrain with the grace of a seasoned sorcerer, ensuring everything looks as if it's been there since time immemorial.
- Summon forth a body of water, making sure it blends harmoniously with its surroundings.
- Purify the terrain mesh, removing any anomalies that disrupt the natural flow of the world.
- Mold the terrain to ensure all objects and elements are integrated seamlessly, creating a vista that invites exploration.

Feel empowered to modify data as you see fit, but remember: the goal is to craft a distribution that's not only mesmerizing but also viable for a modern game environment. Keep your incantations within reasonable limits of instances and mesh variations.

## Installation

Welcome to the enchanting setup process for Wim's World! To ensure a smooth journey into this whimsical realm, follow these magical steps:

### Preparing Your Spellbook (Installation Instructions)

1. **Locate the `Wim-s-World_Package.json` File**:
   - Begin by finding the `Wim-s-World_Package.json` file. It's the key to unlocking the gates to Wim's World in your Houdini environment.

2. **Copy the JSON File to Houdini's Packages Folder**:
   - With the JSON file at hand, navigate to your Houdini packages folder. You'll typically find this mystical place in your Documents folder, under `Houdini`.
   - If by chance you do not see a `packages` folder there, fear not! Simply conjure one into existence by creating a new folder and naming it `packages`.
   - Place the `Wim-s-World_Package.json` file within this newly formed or pre-existing `packages` folder.

### Enchanting the JSON File with Your Local Magic

Before you proceed, there's a small yet crucial enchantment required:

1. **Modify the `WIMSWORLD` Variable**:
   - Open the `Wim-s-World_Package.json` file with a text editor of your choice. Here, you'll find a variable named `WIMSWORLD` that holds the power to link your local realm to Wim's World.
   - You must change the value of `WIMSWORLD` from its current path (`"C:/Github/Wim-s-World"`) to the path where you've decided to store Wim's World on your local machine. This ensures that Houdini can accurately find and harness the assets of Wim's World.

### Finalizing the Spell

With the `Wim-s-World_Package.json` file correctly placed and enchanted with your local directory path, you're nearly ready to step into the whimsical world of Wim:

- Restart Houdini to allow the magic to take effect. Houdini will now recognize Wim's World and all the wonders it contains, thanks to the spell you've just woven with the JSON file.

And just like that, you're ready! The portals to Wim's World are open, and endless adventures await. We're thrilled to see the creations you'll bring to life within this magical realm. Happy creating!

Embark on this journey with a heart full of adventure and a mind open to possibilities. We're excited to see the worlds you'll create and the magic you'll unleash. Welcome to Wim's World, where every creation is a step closer to wonder.
